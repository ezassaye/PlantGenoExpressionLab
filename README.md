# PlantGenoExpressionLab
This project explores how plants adapt to environmental stress by analyzing gene expression patterns under conditions such as heat, drought, and cold. Using publicly available datasets, including the ArrayExpress E-CURD-1 dataset, the study focuses on identifying stress-specific gene activity and clustering genes with similar expression responses. A computational approach involving Python and R is used to preprocess data, perform clustering analysis, and create visualizations like heatmaps. The research aims to uncover mechanisms of plant resilience, contribute to advancing agricultural practices, and equip researchers with skills in computational biology and data analysis.
